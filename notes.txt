AVL tree - https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html
    - Ensure the delta in height of subtrees is never more than one 
      by rotating branches.

Red Black tree - https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html
    - Ensure that the longest path is at most twice the length of the shortest
